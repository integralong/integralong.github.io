[Can our brain talk to our immune system?](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/can-our-brain-talk-to-our-immune-system)


<!-- Why Immune System is Interesting?
Youth is not forever, the engine of our lives is immune system.


I've been interested in immune system since I was young, however, it gets bigger since I moved all around the world. Depends on my immune system and each different environemnt gave me special occaision disease. The medical settings can be easily to understand when you are in the situations, and experiences how the small amount of different from normal life can affect your life big. -->

Relationship between Neuro-immune memory, Neuroinflammation, and Brain Tumors.

Does the brain remember sickness? the dobule-edged sword of neuro-immune memory?

We often think of the brain as a hard drive of memories
**strong faces, facts, and feelings**. 

But recent neuroscience suggests it also "remembers" our body's phycial battles.
Through a phenomenon called Neuro-immune memory, the brain records past inflammatory events to prepare for future threats.

But if the brain is such a great protector, why do we still suffer from brain inflammatioin or brain tumors?

1. The brain's private security: Microglia
While the rest of your body relies on white blood cells, the brain has its own elite security team: Microglia.

* The Memory: When the body gets sick, areas like the Insular Cortex record the inflammatory signal.
* The glitch (Priminig): If these cells become "over-primed" due to chronic stress or repeated infection, they don't just fight enemies, they start damaging heaelthy neurons. This "overreaction" is what we called Neuroinflammation, a key driver of depression and dementia.

2. Why the shield fails: Inflammation and Cancer
If the brain "remembers" immunity, how do diseases like tumors slip through?
* The invisible fire (neuroinflammation): unlike a swollen ankle, brain inflammation is chemical. Microglia release toxic cytokines that disrupt neural circuits. Because the brain remembers these states, even minor stress can re-trigger a massive inflammatory response.

* The great deception (brain tumors): cancer cells are masters of manipulation. They "brainwash" the local microglia, turning them from soldiers into "nurses" that help the tumor grow. By exploiting the blood-brain barrier, tumors hide in a sanctuary where the body's general immune system can't easily reach them. -->
