## Research Overview

### Abstract 


### Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a serious public health concern and remains among the leading causes of cancer mortality globally. Screening for early detection of colorectal cancer is crucial in the prevention of incidence and mortality.

Two common employed CRC screening methods are colonoscopy and multi-target sstool DNA (MT-sDNA), or Cologuard. Both methods are to detect CRC at an early stage to improve patient outcomes. Colonoscopy is an invasive procedure in which a felxible tube with a camera is inserted into the colon to visually inspect the whole bowel for irregularities. It offers the ability to immediately remove detected polyps and is generally recommended every ten years for average-risk patients. In contrast, the Mt-sDNA test is a non-invasive stool test that detects occult blood and genetic markers for CRC. This testing is conducted at home and does not involve sedation or bowel prep and is typically recommended every three years.

Although Cologuard can identify aberrant blood and DNA linked to precancerous lesions and cancer with convenience, it may miss some advanced adenomas and has a greater false-positive rate. Colonoscopy enables direct vision, biopsy, and removal of polyps, offering advantages for both diagnosis and prevention due to higher sensitivity.

The purpose of this research project is to help determine the clinical effectiveness of Cologuard and colonoscopy when screening for colon cancer.

### Results

> *Figure 2* The performance markers used for this table included the specificity, sensitivity, reduction in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence, and reduction in CRC mortality. Both tests show similar results, with the only significant difference im reduction in CRC incidence which is higher in colonoscopies.
