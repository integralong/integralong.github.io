Meetings: Every Tuesday Period 7(1:55-2:45) in LIT 368


### Week 1
Reading
* "Introduction" Section of <i>How to mathematically optimize drug regimens using optimal control, referred to as "main paper."

* Guied Questions
1. Why is optimal control preferred to standard "guess-and-check" methods?
2. How "good" does a model have to be to apply optimal control to it?
3. What does QSP stand for? Compare optimal control systems to QSP models.
4. Take a look at the outline in figure 1. What questions or comments about it can you come up with?
