<h2 id="linking-in-style">Linking in Style</h2>

<p>Ever since the introduction of Dark Mode, link styles have been a bit of an issue. Specifically, finding an accent color that worked on both light and dark backgrounds was the problem. With Hydejack 9, the <a href="#linking-in-style">link style</a> has been revamped so that legibility is no longer tied to the choice of accent_color, giving you much more freedom in creating a unique design flavor for your site.</p>

<h2 id="ready-for-the-big-screen">Ready for the Big Screen</h2>

<p>The theme on which Hydejack is based was designed for a different era of the web. Hydejack has inherited many of its limitations, but over time I’ve made adjustments, such as centering the content column for better reading ergonomics.</p>

<p>With version 9, Hydejack takes full advantage of large displays. Whether it’s design indulgences such as oversized headlines, or quality of life improvements such as a floating table of contents, Hydejack now finds use for all that extra screen real estate<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-the-cards">What’s in the Cards?</h2>

<p>Hydejack 9 now lets you use content cards for both projects and posts. 
The cards have been redesigned with a new hover style and drop shadows and they retain their unique transition-to-next-page animations, which now also work on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog</code> layout. The new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grid</code> layout lets you do that.</p>

<p>Good images are key to making the most out of content cards. For that reason, a <a href="/docs/basics/#adding-images">chapter on images</a> has been added to the documentation.</p>

<h2 id="built-in-search">Built-In Search</h2>

<p>Hydejack now has Built-In Search. It even works offline. I’ve been prototyping many approaches and eventually settled on a fully client-side, off-the-main thread solution that perfectly fits the use case of personal sites and shows surprisingly good results<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The new search UI is custom made for Hydejack and shows beautiful previews of your posts and pages, right on top of your regular content.</p>

<p>Together with the Auto-Hiding Navbar, your entire content library is now only a couple of keystrokes away.</p>

<h2 id="auto-hiding-navbar">Auto-Hiding Navbar</h2>

<p>A navbar that’s there when you need it, and disappears when you don’t. Simple as that.</p>

<h2 id="sticky-table-of-contents">Sticky Table of Contents</h2>

<p>Already a staple on so many sites on the web, this pattern is now also available in Hydejack. 
What’s unique about it is that it simply picks up the table of contents already created by kramdown’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{:toc}</code> tag and transparently upgrades it to a fully dynamic version.</p>

<h2 id="and-much-more">…and much more</h2>

<p>Other noteworthy changes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for Jekyll 4</li>
  <li>Choice between MathJax and KaTeX for math rendering</li>
  <li>Use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-include-cache</code> for drastically improved page building speeds</li>
  <li>New variables configuration file — adjust content width, sidebar width, font size, etc…</li>
  <li>…and the option to disable grouping projects by year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read the the <a href="/CHANGELOG/" class="heading flip-title">CHANGELOG</a> for the full scope of features and improvements made in Hydejack 9.
Maybe just glance at it to confirm that it is indeed a pretty long list.</p>

<h2 id="even-more-to-come">Even More to Come</h2>

<p>New features for 9.1 are already lined up. Code block headers and code line highlights for even better technical blogging, as well as download buttons on the resume page for PDF, vCard, and Resume JSON are just around the corner.</p>

<h2 id="get-it-now">Get It Now</h2>
<p>The Free Version of Hydejack is now availabe on <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-theme-hydejack">RubyGems</a>
and for the first time also on <a href="https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack/packages">GitHub Packages</a>. 
The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack">GitHub</a> as always.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a serious public health concern and remains among the leading causes of cancer mortality globally. Screening for early detection of colorectal cancer is crucial in the prevention of incidence and mortality.</p>

<p>Two common employed CRC screening methods are colonoscopy and multi-target sstool DNA (MT-sDNA), or Cologuard. Both methods are to detect CRC at an early stage to improve patient outcomes. Colonoscopy is an invasive procedure in which a felxible tube with a camera is inserted into the colon to visually inspect the whole bowel for irregularities. It offers the ability to immediately remove detected polyps and is generally recommended every ten years for average-risk patients. In contrast, the Mt-sDNA test is a non-invasive stool test that detects occult blood and genetic markers for CRC. This testing is conducted at home and does not involve sedation or bowel prep and is typically recommended every three years.</p>

<p>Although Cologuard can identify aberrant blood and DNA linked to precancerous lesions and cancer with convenience, it may miss some advanced adenomas and has a greater false-positive rate. Colonoscopy enables direct vision, biopsy, and removal of polyps, offering advantages for both diagnosis and prevention due to higher sensitivity.</p>

<p>The purpose of this research project is to help determine the clinical effectiveness of Cologuard and colonoscopy when screening for colon cancer.</p>

<h2 id="research-overview">Research Overview</h2>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>During and following the COVID-19 pandamic, the use of telehealth has been greatly increased due to its effectiveness in providing contactless healthcare. Telehealth has particularly shown promise in reaching people who cannot access in-person healthcare due to reasons incuding but not limited to scarcity of neaby medical centers, lack of transportion, and lack of finances.</p>

<p>This systematic review evaluates experimental and review articles to determine the global impact and effectiveness of telehealth practices. The results of this review demonstrated that telehealth has greatly improved accessbility and facilitating easy access to information through e-record systems.</p>

<p>Telehealth has also made improvements in quality of care for underserved populations and in closing the healthcare gap between urban and rural patients. Telehealth has been particularly beneficial in areas such as cancer screenings, chronic condition management, addressing acute medical emergencies, and pediatric care.</p>

<p>However, research has also found that while telehealth can close mobility and transportation gaps, disparities due to insufficient internet, lack of access to devices, and language barriers continue to persis.</p>

<p>Overall, this review has determined that telehealth has significant benefits for improving access to and quality of medical care, especially for people in rural or underserved areas. However, it is important to address continuing disparities through further research such as by exploring training for healthcare professionals and investigatin how to close telehealth-related barriers for certain demographics such as older adults and racial and ethnic minorities.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the landscape of healthcare delivery worldwide, fostering the expansion of telehealth. Telehealth utilization represents an adaptation to the challenges of providing continous healthcare admist restrctions on physical mobility and social distancing. The pandemic have thrust telehealth to the forefront, showcasing its potential to bridge gaps in access to healthcare services. The shift towards telehealth opened new avenues for patient care, extending reach of medical services to populations that previously faced substantial barriers to access.</p>

<p>This review aims to assess the global impact and effectiveness of telehealth practices during and follwong the pandemic, evaluating its role in enhancing accessbility, quality of care, and its potential in mitigating healthcare disparities.</p>

<p>By analyzing scholarly articles, it seeks to understand how telehealth has improved healthcare accessbility and quality, especially for those previously hindered by distance, transportation issues, or financial limitations, while also acknowledging ongoing disparities such as internet access, device availability, and language barriers. The review intends to offer insights into telehealth’s benefits and areas requiring further research to enhance its equity and effectiveness across all demographics.</p>

<h3 id="methods-and-materials">Methods and Materials</h3>
<p>Articles discussing the effects of telehealth on healthcare-deprived and low-resource communities were collected and screened throguh Rayyan. A systematic review was then conducted to filter through various study methods and variables to determine relevancy to the research topic.</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>The latest study underscores the positive impacts of telehealth utilization within communities, especially those catering to healthcare-deprived or low-resource demographics. However, it also brings attention to pertinent issues, particularly from an economic standpoint, as the costs of essential telehealth equipment pose a significant challenge.</p>

<p>By addressing these challenges directly, it can be ensured that telehealth’s influential promise is fulfilled, resulting in more equitable access to healthcare services for all individuals, regardless of geographical location or socioecnomic status.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Telehealth initiatives have demonstrated significant strides in extending their reach to underserved populations, including within developing nations where technology adoption remains sparse. Health care professionals advocate for Telehealth, asserting that the caliber of care delivered via this digital platform is commensurate with that of traditional in-person consultations. Its applicability ranges from chronic disease management to acute emergency situations, enhancing accessibility and quality of healthcare services. Moreover, with the improved accessbility of medical information through research programs like INvest clinical trials and initiatives like GIVE, remote healthcare services are expanding. For example, a study conducted revealed that more than half of children who suffer from asthma fail to attend their in-person medical appointments due to transportation difficulties.</p>

<p>Telehealth has played a crucial role in overcoming these financial and logistical obstacles, enabling families globally to access medical care from a physician without the burdens that traditionally hinder patient care. The findings from scholarly articles provide insightful and quantitative evidence on Telehealth’s positive effect on various communities, such as low-income families and the elderly.</p>]]></content><author><name>Lauren Song</name><email>ahyeonsong@ufl.edu</email></author><category term="projects" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
