</div>


Welcome to my second research project! This research project compares two major colorectal cancer screening methodsâ€”**CologuardÂ® (MT-sDNA)** and **colonoscopy**â€”to determine which is more clinically effective in early detection. Our goal was to assess their respective strengths, limitations, and potential synergy in improving cancer prevention and outcomes.

### Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection is critical for improving survival rates, and two of the most widely used screening methods are colonoscopy and MT-sDNA testing (commercially known as Cologuard).  

While colonoscopy is invasive and requires bowel prep and sedation, Cologuard is a non-invasive stool DNA test that can be done at home. Both have different strengths: colonoscopy enables immediate polyp removal, while Cologuard may encourage screening compliance due to its convenience.

---

### Research Question

> How does the clinical effectiveness of Cologuard compare to colonoscopy in early colorectal cancer detection?

We also explored:
- What are the relative strengths in detection rates for polyps and adenomas?
- Can combining both screening strategies lead to better outcomes?
- What are the implications for improving access and compliance?

### Methodology

#### Data Collection  
We reviewed published literature, including clinical trials and meta-analyses comparing sensitivity, specificity, and detection rates of both methods. Selection criteria were filtered through a defined flowchart (see Figure 1 of the poster).

</div>





#### Evaluation Criteria  
Key clinical markers analyzed included:
- Sensitivity and specificity  
- Missed adenoma rates  
- Detection rates for adenomas and sessile serrated polyps  
- Reduction in CRC incidence and mortality

### Key Findings

1. **Comparable Sensitivity**  
   Both methods show similar performance in detecting colorectal cancer. Cologuard has a 93% sensitivity rate compared to FIT tests.

2. **Complementary Strengths**  
   Colonoscopy outperforms in sessile serrated polyp detection and has a lower missed adenoma rate.  
   Cologuard has higher adenoma detection and no need for prep or sedation.

3. **Improved Outcomes in Combination**  
   Patients who underwent Cologuard followed by colonoscopy showed significantly higher detection rates than those who only had a colonoscopy.

---

### Discussion

This study highlights the benefits of a hybrid screening strategy, particularly for average-risk populations. Cologuard can act as an initial, non-invasive screen, while colonoscopy provides diagnostic and therapeutic advantages. Together, they offer a more inclusive and effective model of early CRC detection.

---

### Limitations

- Cologuard may miss some advanced adenomas and has higher false-positive rates  
- Colonoscopy effectiveness varies based on provider skill and bowel prep quality  
- Further research is needed on long-term cost-efficiency of hybrid screening models

---

### Future Directions

- Evaluate real-world implementation of hybrid CRC screening programs  
- Improve patient education and accessibility, especially for under-screened groups  
- Investigate tech-driven screening enhancements (e.g., AI-supported diagnostics)
