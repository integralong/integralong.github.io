## Engineering Lab Course - Manufacturing Education Robot Project


---

## Executive Summary
Our project focuses on the development of Wheelie, a kid friendly robot designed for K-12 STEM education. The objective is to create an accesible learning tool that encourages engagement and exploration among students while also addressing the barreirs to entry into engineering education.

Wheelie boasts a simple yet engaging design, featuring a rounded box-shaped body that can be
effortlessly assembly by any users within minutes. Its mobility is ensured by wheels on both sides,
supplemented by a fixed wheel at the back for stability. Equipped with an ultrasonic sensor,
Wheelie can navigate its surroundings autonomously, detecting obstacles and adjusting its path.

To enhance interaction, Wheelie incorporates an LCD screen programmed to display expressive
emoji faces. This feature not only adds an element of fun but also facilitates communication
between the robot and its users.

Therefore, we considered various aspects to determine that Wheelie is the most suitable final
candidate design, aligning with our project's goal of enhancing diversity in learning activities for
potential future engineers while lowering the barriers to entry into engineering education. By
incorporating feedback from the survey, we ensured that Wheelie not only meets users'
preferences but also aligns with educational objectives in STEM fields.

Through this iterative process of analysis and optimization, we expect that “Wheelie” would be an
ideal educational tool, fostering curiosity, engagement, and hands-on learning experiences
among K-12 students.

## Introduction
Our project's main goal is to optimize the final design candidate, Wheelie, for K-12 STEM
education and reduce the barriers to entry into engineering education. The purpose of this project
is to broaden the diversity of learning activities for future potential engineers through the robot,
Wheelie, which will be used as an educational tool.
By integrating various features such as sensors, motors, and interactive LCD screens that display
emoji expressions, Wheelie provides hands-on learning experiences that encourage curiosity and
exploration. Through the assembly process, we aim to make engineering learning enjoyable and
easily accessible, while encouraging students to interactively explore concepts in robotics
engineering.
Overall, our project, Wheelie, not only provides hands-on experience by assembling electronic
components and understanding engineering theoretical concepts but also contributes to lowering
the participation and entry barriers in the field of engineering, thus relating to K-12 STEM
education.

Project-based learning primarily utilizes modular robot kits. These kits resemble LEGO in their
format but feature limited design space to minimize assembly time. This provides students with a
sense of satisfaction in assembly, while teachers can allocate sufficient time to introduce activity
processes. Utilizing open-source platforms like Arduino further enhances the suitability for K-12
STEM education by offering reasonable pricing and expandable design space. [1](#references-1)

Utilizing robots as learning tools in technology-based education grants students the right to
explore their skills and knowledge during the learning process, thus fostering independence.
Moreover, through such activities, knowledge can be advanced. As a result, the development of
affordable educational robots over the past few years has demonstrated the promotion of STEM
education by enabling the cultivation of various technological skills. [2](#references-2)

Job-centered hands-on STEM learning in robotics engineering. Task-centered hands-on STEM
learning approaches are effective in students' educational robot learning. STEM education aims
to develop the ability to autonomously explore and solve problems through technical practice.
Utilizing edu-robotics as a bridge to integrate with other domains is helpful for practicing STEM
as edu-robotics itself encompasses various knowledge and skills. STEM learning materials adopt
project-based or problem-based learning approaches, emphasizing learners and encouraging
students to integrate what they have learned to solve problems. For example, Arduino Uno is
highly scalable among controllers, being smaller, lighter, cheaper, and easier to obtain learning
resources and materials for programming. Learning materials emphasize that students can spend
limited time and money applying what they have learned in practical tasks and building robots. [3](#references-3)

The core technology used in our project is Arduino Uno R3, which falls under mechanical
engineering. This includes an H-bridge for motor control, a sensor, and geared motors. Arduino
facilitates user interaction and accessibility, making it easy to build prototypes for the project.
Moreover, Arduino’s ease of access allows for the sharing of tutorials in the market, enabling us
to implement programming tha
