## Potential role and effectiveness of telehealth for healthcare-deprived or low-resource areas globally

### Project Info

2023 Oct â€“ 2024 April, Undergraduate Research Society at University of South Florida 


Team | Maribel Serracin, Giang Ha, Chelsea Gabarron, Maria Hanna, Maddie Jarzabek, Archana Rao, Lauren Song, Gayathri Mannem

#### In short
During the following the COVID-19 pandamic, the use of telehealth has been greatly increased due to its effectiveness in providing contactless healthcare. 


#### Problem
Telehealth has particularly shown promise in reaching people who cannot access in-person healthcare due to reasons including but not limited to scarcity of nearby medical centers, lack of transportation, and lack of finances.

Methods and Materials | Articles discussing the effects of telehealth on
healthcare-deprived and low-resource communities
were collected and screened through Rayyan. A
systematic review was then conducted to filter
through various study methods and variables to
determine relevancy to the research topic.


#### Recap

Conclution

Telehealth initiatives have demonstrated significant strides
in extending their reach to underserved populations,
including lower-income communities, the elderly, and
regions within developing nations where technology
adoption remains sparse. Health care professionals
advocate for Telehealth, asserting that the caliber of care
delivered via this digital platform is commensurate with
that of traditional in-person consultations. Its applicability
ranges from chronic disease management to acute
emergency situations, enhancing accessibility and quality
of healthcare services. Moreover, with the improved
accessibility of medical information through research
programs like INvest clinical trials and initiatives like GIVE,
remote healthcare services are expanding. For example, a
study conducted revealed that more than half of children
who suffer from asthma fail to attend their in-person
medical appointments due to transportation difficulties.
Telehealth has played a crucial role in overcoming these
financial and logistical obstacles, enabling families globally
to access medical care from a physician without the
burdens that traditionally hinder patient care. The findings
from scholarly articles provide insightful and quantitative
evidence on Telehealth's positive effect on various
communities, such as low-income families and the elderly.
